Greetings! My name is George, but I am also known as "TheScriptKid" online. I have been actively engaged in the field of penetration testing since 2013. My initial steps included self-study of fundamental concepts such as Linux, computer networking, security principles, and programming.

In 2017, I made the decision to pursue the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. To gain hands-on experience, I utilized the Hack The Box platform and local vulnerable machines obtained from Vulnhub.

In early 2019, I took a temporary hiatus to focus on my employment at the time. However, in 2021 I earned my Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) certification. Later that same year, I resumed my pursuit of the OSCP.

With the assistance of online resources such as Hack The Box, TryHackMe, Proving Grounds, cheatsheets and notes created by others, as well as the course material and labs provided by Offensive Security, I was able to successfully achieve the OSCP certification in December 2022.

Below, you will find a selection of write-ups and reports that I have personally generated from boxes completed on Hack The Box and Proving Grounds. Additionally, I have also included personal notes that I have compiled throughout my journey in penetration testing.
