Hello! I'm George, also known as "TheScriptKid" online, and I've been actively immersed in penetration testing since 2013. This platform serves as a dynamic showcase of my personal projects, work experiences, challenges, and growth within offensive security.

In 2017, I committed to enhancing my skills by pursuing the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. To gain hands-on expertise, I leveraged platforms like Hack The Box and local vulnerable machines from Vulnhub. Despite a temporary hiatus in 2019 due to employment commitments, I earned the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) certification in 2021, marking a significant milestone.

Returning to my OSCP pursuit later in the same year, I successfully achieved the certification in December 2022. This accomplishment was made possible through the strategic use of online resources, including Hack The Box, TryHackMe, Proving Grounds, cheatsheets, course materials, and labs provided by Offensive Security.

In early 2023, I undertook a challenging role as a Penetration Tester on a three-week contract, which was impressively extended to four months. Within this period, I successfully conducted in-depth penetration tests on various systems, including Active Directory, and identified over 35 high and critical security vulnerabilities.

My journey in this role has been a pivotal part of my professional growth, equipping me with invaluable insights and expertise that I am eager to apply in future cybersecurity challenges.

Below, you'll find a curated selection of write-ups and reports generated from completed challenges on platforms like Hack The Box and Proving Grounds. Additionally, I've included personal notes that capture key insights gained throughout my journey in penetration testing.&#x20;
