Greetings! My name is George or you can call me by my internet name TheScriptKid. I have been on the pen testing journey since 2013. Learning fundamentals such as Linux, computer networking, security concepts, and programming via self-study was my first step.&#x20;

* In late of the year 2017, I decided to pursue the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) by first gaining hands-on experience using Hack The Box platform and local vulnerable machines downloaded from Vulnhub.
* In early 2019 I took a step backward to refine my skills and focus on my job at the time.&#x20;
* In midyear 2021, I received my Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA). Towards the end of 2021, I jumped back into pursuing the OSCP. &#x20;
* With the help of online resources such as HTB, TryHackMe, Proving Grounds, Cheatsheets, notes by others, and of course Offensive Security's Course Material/Lab allowed me to finally receive my certification in December of this year 2022.

Below are a few writeups and reports that I have personally created from boxes that I have done in HTB and Proving Grounds. I also have personal notes that I have formulated throughout my pen testing journey.
